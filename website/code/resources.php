                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Kyoto Protocol (1997)</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        <strong>What It Is:</strong> A legally binding international treaty that set emission reduction
                        targets for industrialized countries.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        <strong>Impact:</strong> The protocol’s mechanisms, such as carbon trading and the Clean
                        Development Mechanism (CDM), provided financial incentives for countries like Nepal to invest in
                        green energy and climate-resilient infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        <strong>Why It Matters Now:</strong> While no longer in effect, the Kyoto Protocol laid the
                        groundwork for future climate agreements like the Paris Agreement.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        <strong>What It Is:</strong> A landmark global climate pact where each country sets its own
                        targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, known as Nationally Determined Contributions
                        (NDCs).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        <strong>Key Points:</strong>

                        <li>Aims to limit global warming to below 2°C and make efforts to cap it at 1.5°C.</li>
                        <li>Countries must update their NDCs every five years to reflect increased ambition in fighting
                            climate change.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The Paris Agreement is a critical tool for global climate
                        action, and understanding it helps young leaders advocate for stronger NDCs and hold governments
                        accountable.

                        <strong>What It Is:</strong> A financial mechanism established at COP27 to provide funding for
                        countries suffering the unavoidable impacts of climate change.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">

                            contribute significantly to the fund.</li>

                        communities, can benefit greatly from this fund to protect its people from the adverse effects
                        of climate change.
